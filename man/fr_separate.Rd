\usage{
fr_separate(.data, dateVar = NULL, timeVar = NULL, dateTimeVar = NULL,
                   tracerVar, fractionVar, starts, ends, hours, ppt, checkOverlap = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.data}{The working dataframe}

\item{dateVar}{The variable holding date data}

\item{timeVar}{The variable holding time data}

\item{dateTimeVar}{The variable holding time data}

\item{tracerVar}{The variable holding the tracer data for the mixing model}

\item{fractionVar}{The name of a new variable to hold the results of the separation}

\item{starts}{Start times of floods}

\item{ends}{End times of floods}

\item{hours}{Number of hours to look back as baseflow conditions for the tracerVar}

\item{ppt}{The value to use for precipitation in mixing model}

\item{checkOverlap}{Logical value to check if baseflows overlap}
}
\value{
A dataframe with a new variable holding baseflow frations for each flood with
attributes about which baseflow values/times were used in the separations.
}
\description{
This function takes start and end dates of floods and calculates
the baseflow fraction during the flood based on a two end member mixing model.
